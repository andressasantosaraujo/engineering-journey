## From Backend Specialist to Full-Stack Engineer

For most of my career, I identified strongly as a backend engineer.

I worked on APIs, distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, and SaaS platforms. I cared deeply about performance, reliability, and clean system boundaries.

That changed this year.

After my company was acquired and I joined a fully full-stack engineering team, I realised something important:  
this wasn’t a gap I needed to *rush* to close, it was an opportunity to grow intentionally.

### Why I Didn’t “Just Learn React”

I’ve seen many engineers approach frontend learning by jumping straight into frameworks and patterns. I didn’t want that.

Instead, I approached it the same way I approach backend systems:
- How does data flow?
- Where does state live?
- What are the failure modes?
- How does this scale over time?

React stopped feeling like “frontend magic” once I reframed it as:
> functions + state + events + async data

### Learning in Production, Not in Isolation

I’m learning frontend and Node.js while working on real production systems, not side projects disconnected from reality.

That means:
- Reading existing code before writing new code
- Making small, safe changes
- Documenting decisions and trade-offs
- Writing tests and improving reliability as I go

Progress is slower this way, and much deeper.

### Why I’m Documenting This Journey

This repository and my writing are not about teaching others how to code.

They exist to:
- Make my thinking visible
- Capture lessons while they’re fresh
- Build a habit of documentation
- Create evidence of growth over time

### What’s Next

Over the next months, I’ll be writing about:
- Learning React as a backend engineer
- Node.js and TypeScript in production
- GraphQL from both sides of the API
- Testing and error handling across the stack
- Growing from senior engineer into technical leadership

If you’re on a similar path or considering one, you’re not behind.
You’re evolving.
