# Full-Stack Engineering Journey

## About Me

I’m Andressa Araújo, a senior software engineer with over 10 years of experience in backend development, APIs, and SaaS platforms.

My background is primarily in backend systems (Go, AWS, distributed systems), and I’m currently expanding intentionally into **full-stack engineering and technical leadership** within a modern SaaS environment.

This repository documents that journey.

## Why This Repository Exists

This repo serves three purposes:

1. **Learning log** – capturing what I learn as I work across frontend, backend, and system architecture
2. **Evidence of growth** – real artifacts from production systems
3. **Leadership signal** – documentation, diagrams, and reflections that show system thinking and ownership

This is not a tutorial repo.
It is a record of real engineering work and decisions.

## What I’m Focusing On

- React & modern frontend development (from a backend engineer’s perspective)
- Node.js & TypeScript backend services
- GraphQL APIs and data flow
- Testing, reliability, and CI/CD
- System design, trade-offs, and documentation
- Growing from senior engineer into technical leadership

## Repository Structure
```
notes/ # Learning notes and reflections
diagrams/ # Architecture and system diagrams
posts/ # Long-form writing and reflections
projects/ # Small focused experiments or refactors
evidence-log.md # Weekly log of impact and outcomes
```

## How to Read This Repo

- Start with `/posts` for higher-level reflections
- Browse `/diagrams` to understand system thinking
- `/notes` contains raw, evolving learning notes
- `/evidence-log.md` captures weekly impact

---

## Engineering Values

- Clarity over cleverness
- Documentation is part of the job
- Systems > components
- Consistency beats intensity
- Learning in production, not isolation

Most examples are simplified or anonymised.
This repository reflects **how I think**, not proprietary systems.
